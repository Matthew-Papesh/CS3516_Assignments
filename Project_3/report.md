## Overview: 
The objective of this assignment was to explore and implement a client to ping a server while simulating packet loss. This is done by anticipating some packets sent to the server from the client will not be retuned when the client pings the server. Pinging is used to send a message from the client and have it echoed or repeated by the server transmitting it back. All communication is done by UDP. Packet loss is demonstrated to represent how UDP can be unreliable as it is never ensured that data being transmitted is always getting received.
